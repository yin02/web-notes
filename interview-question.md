HTML

### 1. What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the language of the internet. It is the standard text formatting language used for creating and displaying pages on the Internet

HTML documents are made up of the elements and the tags that format it for proper display on pages.

### 2. What are HTML tags?

We use HTML tags for placing the elements in the proper and appropriate format. Tags use the symbols <, and > to set them apart from the HTML content.

The [HTML tags](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/html-tutorial/html-tags) need not be closed always. For example, in the case of images, the closing tags are not required as <img> tag.

### 3. What are HTML Attributes?

Attributes are the properties that can be added to an HTML tag. These attributes change the way the tag behaves or is displayed. For example, a <img> tag has an src attribute, which you use to add the source from which the image should be displayed.

We add attributes right after the name of the HTML tag, inside the brackets. We can only add the attributes to opening or self-closing tags, but never be in closing tags.

### 4.  What are the features of HTML?

**Ans.** The following are the features of HTML: 

1. It is a markup language that provides flexibility to design web pages with text.
2. It is easy to use and learn. 
3. HTML is platform-independent and can be used on Windows, Linux, Macintosh, etc.
4. It enables programmers to add images, video, and audio to a web page to make it more interactive.
5. HTML allows programmers to add a link on web pages, helping the readers to browse the information of their interest.
6. It is case-insensitive. You can use tags either in lower-case or upper-case.

### 5. How do you separate a section of texts in HTML?

We separate a section of texts in HTML using the below tags:

- <br> tag – It is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and shifts the flow of the text to a new line.
- <p> tag–This tag is used to write a paragraph of text.
- <blockquote> tag–This tag is used to define large quoted sections.

### 6. Define the list types in HTML?

The list types in HTML are as below:

- Ordered list–The ordered list uses <ol> tag and displays elements in a numbered format.
- Unordered list–The unordered list uses <ul> tag and displays elements in a bulleted format.
- Definition list–The definition list uses <dl>, <dt>, <dd> tags and displays elements in definition form like in a dictionary.

### 7. How do you align list elements in an HTML file?

We can align the list elements in an HTML file by using indents. If you indent each nested list in further than the parent list, you can easily align and determine the various lists and the elements that it contains.

### 8. Differentiate between an Ordered list and an Unordered list?

An unordered list uses <ul> </ul> tags and each element of the list is written between <li> </li> tags. The list items are displayed as bullets rather than numbers.

An ordered list uses <ol> </ol> tags and each element of the list is written between <li> </li> tags. The list items are displayed as numbers rather than bullet points.

### 9. What is an element in HTML?

An element in HTML is a set of tags that define a specific part of a web page. It consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag.

### 10. What is the difference between HTML and CSS?

HTML is used to create the structure and content of a web page, while CSS is used to define the appearance and layout of the page.

### 11. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

No, HTML tags are used to define the structure of a web page, while HTML elements are made up of a set of tags that define a specific part of a web page.

### 12. How do you create a hyperlink in HTML?

We use the anchor tag <a> to create a hyperlink in HTML that links one page to another page. The hyperlink can be added to images too. 

### 13. What are the different types of lists in HTML?

There are three lists in HTML: ordered, unordered, and definition. Ordered lists are numbered lists, unordered lists are bulleted lists, and definition lists are lists of terms and their definitions.

### 14. What is the ‘class' attribute in HTML?

The ‘class' attribute in HTML defines a class for an HTML element. It can be used to apply a specific style to a group of elements on a web page.

### 15. What is the difference between the ‘id' and ‘class' attributes of HTML elements?

The ‘id' attribute defines a unique identifier for an HTML element, while the ‘class' attribute defines a class for a group of elements. An ‘id' can only be used once on a page, while a ‘class' can be used multiple times.

### 16. What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?

HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and includes new features and improvements over previous versions. Some key differences between HTML and HTML5 include support for multimedia elements (such as video and audio), improved semantics, and better support for mobile devices.

### 17. What is the role of the <head> tag in HTML?

The <head> tag defines information about the web page that is not displayed on the page itself, such as its title, keywords, and other metadata. It is located between the <html> and <body> tags and is usually the first element in the document.

### 18. What is the role of the <meta> tag in HTML?

The <meta> tag provides additional information about the web page, such as the author, description, and keywords. It is located within the <head> section of the HTML document.

### 19. What is the difference between an absolute and relative URL?

An absolute URL includes the full web address, the protocol (such as http or https) and the domain name (such as www.example.com). A relative URL, on the other hand, specifies the location of a resource relative to the current web page. For example, a relative URL might include the file path (such as /images/picture.jpg) or the relative path (such as ../images/picture.jpg).

### 20. What is the role of the alt attribute in HTML?

The alt attribute provides alternative text for an image in case the image cannot be displayed. This is important for accessibility, as screen readers can read the alt text to describe the image to visually impaired users.

### 21. What is the role of the title attribute in HTML

The title attribute provides additional information about an element, such as a link or an image. The title text is displayed as a tooltip when a user hovers over the element.

### 22. What is a form in HTML?

A form is a set of input fields and other elements to collect user data. Forms can be used for various purposes, such as logging in, submitting feedback, or purchasing.

### 23. What are the different types of form input fields in HTML?

Several form input fields in HTML include text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, select menus, and text areas. Each input field type is used to collect different types of data from users.

### 24. What is the role of the action attribute in HTML forms?

The action attribute is used to specify the URL of the script or program that will process the data submitted by the form. When the user clicks the submit button, the form data is sent to the specified URL for processing.

### 25. What is the difference between an absolute and relative URL?

An absolute URL includes the full web address, the protocol (such as http or https) and the domain name (such as www.example.com). A relative URL, on the other hand, specifies the location of a resource relative to the current web page. For example, a relative URL might include the file path (such as /images/picture.jpg) or the relative path (such as ../images/picture.jpg).

### 26. What is the role of the alt attribute in HTML?

The alt attribute provides alternative text for an image in case the image cannot be displayed. This is important for accessibility, as screen readers can read the alt text to describe the image to visually impaired users.

### 27. What is the role of the title attribute in HTML?

The title attribute provides additional information about an element, such as a link or an image. The title text is displayed as a tooltip when a user hovers over the element.

### 28. What is a form in HTML?

A form is a set of input fields and other elements to collect user data. Forms can be used for various purposes, such as logging in, submitting feedback, or purchasing.

### 29. What are the different types of form input fields in HTML?

Several form input fields in HTML include text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, select menus, and text areas. Each input field type is used to collect different types of data from users.

### 30. What is the role of the action attribute in HTML forms?

The action attribute is used to specify the URL of the script or program that will process the data submitted by the form. When the user clicks the submit button, the form data is sent to the specified URL for processing.

### 31. What are the different new form element types in HTML 5?

Following is a list of 10 frequently used new elements in HTML 5:

- Color
- Date
- Datetime-local
- Email
- Time
- Url
- Range
- Telephone
- Number
- Search

### 32. Which type of video formats are supported by HTML5?

HTML 5 supports three types of video format:

- mp4
- WebM
- Ogg

###  33. Is audio tag supported in HTML 5?

Yes. It is used to add sound or music files on the web page. There are three supported file formats for HTML 5 audio tag.

1. mp3
2. WAV
3. Ogg

### **34. What is the difference between block and inline elements?**

Every element in HTML has a default display value which depends upon the element type. **Block** or **inline** is the default display value for most of the elements.

**Block-Level Elements:** A block-level element always starts on a new line and stretches out to the left and right as far as it can.

- **div element:** The **div element** is used as a container for other HTML elements. It has no required attributes. *Style*, *class,* and *id* are the commonly used attributes.
- **span element:** The span element is used as a container for text. It has no required attributes. *Style*, *class,* and *id* are the commonly used attributes.

## 2. CSS 

### 1. How do you add CSS styling in HTML?

There are three ways to include the CSS with HTML:

- Inline CSS: It is used when less amount of styling is needed or in cases where only a single element has to be styled. To use inline styles add the style attribute in the relevant tag.
- External Style Sheet: This is used when the style is applied to many elements or HTML pages. Each page must link to the style sheet using the <link> tag.

- Internal Style Sheet: It is used when a single HTML document has a unique style and several elements need to be styled to follow the format. Internal styles sheet is added in the head section of an HTML page, by using the <style> tag:

### 2. What is the Box model in CSS? Which CSS properties are a part of it?

A rectangle box is wrapped around every HTML element. The box model is used to determine the height and width of the rectangular box. The CSS Box consists of Width and height (or in the absence of that, default values and the content inside), padding, borders, margin.

- **Content:**  Actual Content of the box where the text or image is placed.
- **Padding:** Area surrounding the content (Space between the border and content).
- **Border:** Area surrounding the padding.
- **Margin:** Area surrounding the border.

### 3. What are the advantages of using CSS?

The main advantages of CSS are given below:

- **Separation of content from presentation -** CSS provides a way to present the same content in multiple presentation formats in mobile or desktop or laptop.
- **Easy to maintain -** CSS, built effectively can be used to change the look and feel complete by making small changes. To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated automatically.
- **Bandwidth -** Used effectively, the style sheets will be stored in the browser cache and they can be used on multiple pages, without having to download again.

### 4. What are the different types of Selectors in CSS?

A CSS selector is the part of a CSS ruleset that actually selects the content you want to style. Different types of selectors are listed below.

**Universal Selector:** The universal selector works like a wildcard character, selecting all elements on a page. In the given example, the provided styles will get applied to all the elements on the page.

**Element Type Selector:** This selector matches one or more HTML elements of the same name. In the given example, the provided styles will get applied to all the ul elements on the page.

**ID Selector:** This selector matches any HTML element that has an ID attribute with the same value as that of the selector. In the given example, the provided styles will get applied to all the elements having ID as a container on the page.

**Class Selector:** The class selector also matches all elements on the page that have their class attribute set to the same value as the class.  In the given example, the provided styles will get applied to all the elements having ID as the box on the page.

**Descendant Combinator:** The descendant selector or, more accurately, the descendant combinator lets you combine two or more selectors so you can be more specific in your selection method.

This declaration block will apply to all elements that have a class of box that is inside an element with an ID of the container. It’s worth noting that the `.box` element doesn’t have to be an immediate child: there could be another element wrapping `.box`, and the styles would still apply.

**Child Combinator:** A selector that uses the child combinator is similar to a selector that uses a descendant combinator, except it only targets immediate child elements.

The selector will match all elements that have a class of `box` and that are immediate children of the `#container` element. That means, unlike the descendant combinator, there can’t be another element wrapping `.box` it has to be a direct child element.

**General Sibling Combinator:** A selector that uses a general sibling combinator to match elements based on sibling relationships. The selected elements are beside each other in the HTML.

**Adjacent Sibling Combinator:** A selector that uses the adjacent sibling combinator uses the plus symbol (+), and is almost the same as the general sibling selector. The difference is that the targeted element must be an immediate sibling, not just a general sibling.

**Attribute Selector:** The attribute selector targets elements based on the presence and/or value of HTML attributes, and is declared using square brackets.

### 5. What is VH/VW (viewport height/ viewport width) in CSS?

It’s a CSS unit used to measure the height and width in percentage with respect to the viewport. It is used mainly in responsive design techniques. The measure VH is equal to 1/100 of the height of the viewport. If the height of the browser is 1000px, 1vh is equal to 10px. Similarly, if the width is 1000px, then 1 vw is equal to 10px.

### 6. What is the difference between inline, inline-block, and block?

**Block Element:** The block elements always start on a new line. They will also take space for an entire row or width. List of block elements are <div>, <p>.

**Inline Elements:** Inline elements don't start on a new line, they appear on the same line as the content and tags beside them. Some examples of inline elements are <a>, <span> , <strong>, and <img> tags. 

**Inline Block Elements:** Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, except they can have padding and margins and set height and width values.

### 7. What are Pseudo elements and Pseudo classes?

**Pseudo-elements** allows us to create items that do not normally exist in the document tree, for example ::after.

- ::before
- ::after
- ::first-letter
- ::first-line
- ::selection

**Pseudo-classes** select regular elements but under certain conditions like when the user is hovering over the link.

- :link
- :visited
- :hover
- :active
- :focus

### 8. How do you specify units in the CSS?. What are the different ways to do it?

There are different ways to specify units in CSS like px, em, pt, percentage (%). px(Pixel) gives fine-grained control and maintains alignment because 1 px or multiple of 1 px is guaranteed to look sharp. px is not cascade. em maintains relative size. you can have responsive fonts. Em, will cascade 1em is equal to the current font-size of the element or the browser default. If u sent font-size to 16px then 1em = 16px. The common practice is to set default body font-size to 62.5% (equal to 10px).

pt(point) are traditionally used in print. 1pt = 1/72 inch and it is a fixed-size unit.

%(percentage) sets font-size relative to the font size of the body. Hence, you have to set the font-size of the body to a reasonable size.

### 9. Does margin-top or margin-bottom have an effect on inline elements?

No, it doesn’t affect the inline elements. Inline elements flow with the contents of the page.

### 10. What are the differences between adaptive design and responsive design?

| Adaptive Design                                              | **Responsive Design**                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Adaptive design focuses on developing websites based on multiple fixed layout sizes. | Responsive design focuses on showing content on the basis of available browser space. |
| When a website developed using adaptive design is opened on the desktop browser, first the available space is detected and then the layout with most appropriate sizes are picked and used for the display of contents. Resizing of browser window has no affect on the design. | When a website developed using responsive design is opened on a desktop browser and when we try to resize the browser window, the content of the website is dynamically and optimally rearranged to accomodate the window. |
| Usually, adaptive designs use six standard screen widths - 320 px, 480 px, 760 px, 960 px, 1200 px, 1600 px. These sizes are detected and appropriate layouts are loaded. | This design makes use of CSS media queries for changing styles depending on the target devices properties for adapting to different screens. |
| It takes a lot of time and effort to first examine the options and realities of the end users and then design best possible adaptive solutions them. | Generally, Responsive design takes much less work to build and design fluid websites that can accomodate content from screen depending on the screen size. |
| Gives a lot of control over the design to develop sites for specific screens. | No much control over the design is offered here.             |

### 11. What is a z-index, how does it function?

z-index is used for specifying the vertical stacking of the overlapping elements that occur at the time of its positioning. It specifies the vertical stack order of the elements positioned that helps to define how the display of elements should happen in cases of overlapping.

The default value of this property is 0 and can be either positive or negative. Apart from 0, the values of the z-index can be:

- Auto: The stack order will be set equal to the parent.
- Number: The number can be positive or negative. It defines the stack order.
- Initial: The default value of 0 is set to the property.
- Inherit: The properties are inherited from the parent.

The elements having a lesser value of z-index is stacked lower than the ones with a higher z-index.

we can see that as the value of the z-index increases along the z-axis, the order of stacking would be towards the top of other elements along the vertical axis.

### 12. What are the properties of flexbox?

Flexbox stands for flexible box and it was introduced around 2017 in CSS with the purpose of providing an efficient way to handle layouts, align elements within them and distribute spaces amongst the items in dynamic/responsive conditions. It provides an enhanced ability to alter the dimensions of the items and make use of the available space in the container efficiently. In order to achieve this, CSS3 provides some properties.

The properties of flexbox are as follows:

- **flex-direction**: This property helps in defining the direction the container should stack the items targetted for flex. The values of this property can be

  - row: Stacks items horizontally from left to right in the flex container.
  - column: Stacks items vertically from top to bottom in the flex container.
  - row-reverse: Stacks items horizontally from right to left in the flex container.
  - column-reverse: Stacks items vertically from bottom to top in the flex container.

- **flex-wrap**

  : This property specifies of the flex items should be wrapped or not. Possible values are:

  - wrap: The flex items would be wrapped if needed.
  - nowrap: This is the default value that says the items won’t be wrapped.
  - wrap-reverse: This specifies that the items will be wrapped if needed but in reverse order.

- **flex-flow**: This property is used for setting both flex-direction and flex-wrap properties in one statement.

- **justify-content**: Used for aligning the flex items. Possible values are:

  - center: It means that all the flex items are present at the center of the container.
  - flex-start: This value states that the items are aligned at the start of the container. This is the default value.
  - flex-end: This value ensures the items are aligned at the end of the container.
  - space-around: This value displays the items having space between, before, around the items.
  - space-between: This value displays items with spaces between the lines.

- **align-items**: This is used for aligning flex items.

- **align-content**: This is used for aligning the flex lines.

### 13. Explain CSS position property?

- **Absolute:** To place an element exactly where you want to place it. absolute position is actually set relative to the element's parent. if no parent is available then the relative place to the page itself (it will default all the way back up to the element).
- **Relative:** "Relative to itself". Setting position: relative; on an element and no other positioning attributes, it will no effect on its positioning. It allows the use of z-index on the element and it limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements. Any child element will be absolutely positioned within that block. 
- **Fixed:** The element is positioned relative to the viewport or the browser window itself. viewport doesn't change if you scroll and hence the fixed element will stay right in the same position. 
- **Static:** Static default for every single page element. The only reason you would ever set an element to position: static is to forcefully remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your control.
- **Sticky:** Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.

### 14. When does DOM reflow occur?

Reflow is the name of the web browser process for re-calculating the positions and geometries of elements in the document, for the purpose of re-rendering part or all of the document. 

Reflow occurs when:

- Insert, remove or update an element in the DOM.
- Modify content on the page, e.g. the text in an input box.
- Move a DOM element.
- Animate a DOM element.
- Take measurements of an element such as offsetHeight or getComputedStyle.
- Change a CSS style.

### 15. Can you name the four types of @media properties?

The four types of @media properties are:

1. All → It’s the default property. Used for all media-type devices.
2. Screen → Used for computer screen, mobile screen.
3. Print → Used for printers.
4. Speech → Used for screen readers.

### 16. What are the different ways to hide the element using CSS?

- Using display property(**display: none**). It’s not available for screen readers. The element will not exist in the DOM if display: none is used.
- Using visibility property(**visibility: hidden**), will take up the space of the element. It will be available to screen reader users. The element will actually be present in the DOM, but not shown on the screen.
- Using position property (**position: absolute**). Make it available outside the screen.

### 17. How does Calc work?

The CSS3 calc() function allows us to perform mathematical operations on property values. Instead of declaring, for example, static pixel values for an element's width, we can use calc() to specify that the width is the result of the addition of two or more numeric values.

```
.foo {
	Width: calc(100px + 50px)
}
```

### 18. What does * { box-sizing: border-box; } do? What are its advantages?

- It makes every element in the document include the padding and border in the element’s inner dimension for the height and width computation.  
- In box-sizing: border-box, The height of an element is now calculated by the content's height + vertical padding + vertical border width.
- The width of an element is now calculated by the content's width + horizontal padding + horizontal border width.

### 19. What does !important mean in CSS?

The style is having the important will have the highest precedence and it overrides the cascaded property.

### 20. What is specificity? How to calculate specificity?

A process of determining which CSS rule will be applied to an element. It actually determines which rules will take precedence. Inline style usually wins then ID then the class value (or pseudo-class or attribute selector), the universal selector (*) has no specificity. ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors.

### 21. How does this property work overflow: hidden?

The overflow property in CSS is used for specifying whether the content has to be clipped or the scrollbars have to be added to the content area when the content size exceeds the specified container size where the content is enclosed. If the value of overflow is hidden, the content gets clipped post the size of the container thereby making the content invisible. For example,

```c
div {
    width: 150px;
    height: 50px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

If the content of the div is very large and exceeds the height of 50px, the content gets clipped post 50px and the rest of the content is not made visible.

### 22. How is the nth-child() different from nth of type selectors?

Both are pseudo-classes (Pseudo-classes are those keywords that specifies the special state of the selected element). The `nth-child()` pseudo-class is used for matching elements based on the number that represents the position of an element based on the siblings. The number is used to match an element on the basis of the element’s position amongst its siblings.

For example,  if we give nth-child(4) for the example class, then the 4th child of the example class is selected irrespective of the element type. 

The `nth-of-type()` pseudo-class is similar to the nth-child but it helps in matching the selector based on a number that represents the position of the element within the elements that are the siblings of its same type. The number can also be given as a function or give keywords like odd or even.

For example, if we give `p:nth-of-type(even)` for the example class, then all the even paragraph tags are selected .

### 23. What is the importance of CSS Sprites?

CSS sprites are used for combining multiple images in a single larger image. They are commonly used for representing icons that are used in the user interfaces. The main advantages of using sprites are:

- It reduces the number of HTTP requests to get data of multiple images as they are acquired only by sending a single request.
- It helps in downloading assets in advance that help display icons or images upon hover or other pseudo-states.
- When there are multiple images, the browser makes separate calls to get the image for each of them. Using sprites, the images are combined in one and we can just call for that image using one call.

Consider an example where our application requires 3 images as shown below (Without Sprites Section). If we are trying to load the images independently, we require 3 different HTTP Requests to get the data. But if we have CSS Sprites where all 3 images are combines into 1 separated by some spaces, then we require only 1 HTTP Request.

We can access each image from the sprite by accessing the positioning properties .

### 24. What are the advantages of External Style Sheets?

- You can create classes for reusing it in many documents.
- By using it, you can control the styles of multiple documents from one file.
- In complex situations, you can use selectors and grouping methods to apply styles.

### 25. Explain the difference between visibility: hidden and display: none?

**visibility: hidden** hides the element, but it occupies space and affects the layout of the document.

**display: none** also hides the element but not occupy space. It will not affect the layout of the document.

### **26. What is the difference between margin and padding?**

- Margin is used to create space around elements and padding is used to create space around elements inside the border.
- We can set the margin property to auto but we cannot set the padding property to auto.
- In Margin property we can allow negative or float number but in padding we cannot allow negative values.
- Margin and padding target all the 4 sides of the element. Margin and padding will work without the border property also. 

### 27. What is CSS Box Model?

The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model.
Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. Some of them are given below:

- borders
- margins
- padding
- Content

- **Border Area:** It is the area between the box’s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and height of the border.
- **Margin Area:** This area consists of space between border and margin. The dimensions of the Margin area are the margin-box width and the margin-box height. It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors.
- **Padding Area:** It includes the element’s padding. This area is actually the space around the content area and within the border box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box and the height of the padding-box.
- **Content Area:** This area consists of content like text, images, or other media content. It is bounded by the content edge and its dimensions are given by content box width and height.

### **28. What is CSS overflow?**

The CSS overflow controls the big content. It tells whether to clip content or to add scroll bars. The overflow contains the following property:

- visible
- hidden
- scroll
- auto

**1. Visible:** The content is not clipped and is visible outside the element box.

**2. Hidden:** The overflow is clipped and the rest of the content is invisible.

**3. Scroll:** The overflow is clipped but a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content. The scrollbar can be horizontal or vertical.

**4. Auto:** It automatically adds a scrollbar whenever it is required.

**Overflow-x and Overflow-y:** This property specifies how to change the overflow of elements. x deals with horizontal edges and y deals with vertical edges.

### **29. What does display:inline-block do?**

**Inline-block:** This feature uses both properties: block and inline. So, this property aligns the div inline but the difference is it can edit the height and the width of the block. Basically, this will align the div both in the block and inline fashion.

### **30. What are the Differences between CSS flexbox and CSS grid?**

CSS Flexbox and Gridare are CSS layout systems, although they have different purposes and qualities. Flexbox is useful for simpler, one-dimensional layouts for regulating item alignment within a container, whereas CSS Grid is great for more complicated, multi-dimensional layouts with a lot of item placement options.

### **31. What is Block Formatting Context? How does it work?**

A Block Formatting Context (BFC) is part of the visual CSS rendering of a web page in which block boxes are laid out. Floats, absolutely positioned elements, inline-blocks, table-cells, table-captions, and elements with overflow other than visible (except when that value has been propagated to the viewport) establish new block formatting contexts.

Knowing how to establish a block formatting context is important because without doing so, the containing box will not contain floated children. This is similar to collapsing margins but more insidious as you will find entire boxes collapsing in odd ways.

A BFC is an HTML box that satisfies at least one of the following conditions:

- The value of float is not none.
- The value of position is neither static nor relative.
- The value of display is table-cell, table-caption, inline-block, flex, or inline-flex.
- The value of overflow is not visible.
- In a BFC, each box’s left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block (for right-to-left formatting, right edges touch).

JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.

### 2. What is the use of isNaN function?

isNan function returns true if the argument is not a number; otherwise, it is false.

### 3. What are undeclared and undefined variables?

Undeclared variables are those that do not exist in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered.

Undefined variables are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.

### 4. What are global variables? How are these variable declared?

Global variables are available throughout the length of the code so that it has no scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable or object. If the var keyword is omitted, a global variable is declared.

**Example:**

// Declare a global: globalVariable = “Test”;

The problems faced by using global variables are the clash of variable names of local and global scope. Also, it is difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.

### 5. What is the working of timers in JavaScript?

Timers are used to execute a piece of code at a set time or repeat the code in a given interval. This is done by using the functions `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `clearInterval.`

The`setTimeout(function, delay)` function is used to start a timer that calls a particular function after the mentioned delay. The `setInterval(function, delay)` function repeatedly executes the given function in the mentioned delay and only halts when canceled. The `clearInterval(id)` function instructs the timer to stop.

Timers are operated within a single thread, and thus events might queue up, waiting to be executed.

### 6. What are the difference between "=", “ == “ and “ === “ operators.

The "=" operator is the assignment operator used to assign a value to a variable. 

The "==" operator is the equality operator that performs type coercion if needed before comparing two values. It compares the values for equality after converting them to a common type. 

The "===" operator is the strict equality operator that compares two values without performing type coercion. It checks for both value and type equality.

In summary:

- The "=" operator is used for assignment.
- The "==" operator performs type coercion before comparison.
- The "===" operator does not perform type coercion and checks for both value and type equality.

“==” checks only for equality in value, whereas “===” is a stricter equality test and returns false if either the value or the type of the two variables are different. It is generally recommended to use the "===" operator for equality comparisons in JavaScript to avoid unexpected behavior due to type coercion.

### 7. What do you mean by NULL in Javascript?

The NULL value is used to represent no value or no object. It implies no object or null string, no valid boolean value, no number, and no array object.

### 8. What are escape characters?

Escape characters (Backslash) is used when working with special characters like single quotes, double quotes, apostrophes, and ampersands. Place backslash before the characters to make it display.

### 9. What are the two basic groups of data types in JavaScript?

- They are as—Primitive
- Reference types

Primitive types are Number, String, Null, Undefined, Boolean and Symbol  data types. Reference types are more complex types like strings and dates.

### 10. What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?

There are three types of errors:

- **Load time errors**: Errors that come up when loading a web page, like improper syntax errors, are known as Load time errors and generate the errors dynamically.
- **Runtime errors**: Errors that come due to misuse of the command inside the HTML language.
- **Logical errors**: These are the errors that occur due to the bad logic performed on a function with a different operation.

### 11. What is the ‘Strict Mode in JavaScript, and how can it be enabled?

Strict Mode adds certain compulsions to JavaScript. Under the strict Mode, JavaScript shows errors for a piece of code, which did not show an error before, but might be problematic and potentially unsafe. Strict Mode also solves some mistakes that hamper the JavaScript engines from working efficiently.

Strict mode can be enabled by adding the string literal “use strict” above the file. This can be illustrated by the given example:

```
function myfunction() {
    "use strict;"
    var v = "This is a strict mode function";
}
```

### 12. How closures work in JavaScript?

The closure is a locally declared variable related to a function that stays in memory when it has returned.

### 13. What is for-in loop in JavaScript?

The for-in loop is used to loop through the properties of an object.

**The syntax for the for-in loop is –**

```
for (variable name in object){
    statement or block to execute
}
```

In each repetition, one property from the object is associated with the variable name. The loop is continued till all the properties of the object are depleted.

### 14. What are the important properties of an anonymous function in JavaScript?

A function that is declared without any named identifier is known as an anonymous function. In general, an anonymous function is inaccessible after its declaration.

###  15. What is the difference between .call() .apply() and .bind()?

1. `call()`: The `call()` method allows you to invoke a function with a specified `this` value and individual arguments passed in as separate parameters. It takes the context object as the first argument, followed by the function arguments.
2. `apply()`: The `apply()` method is similar to `call()`, but it accepts arguments as an array or an array-like object. It also allows you to set the `this` value explicitly.
3. `bind()`: The `bind()` method creates a new function that has a specified `this` value and, optionally, pre-defined arguments. It allows you to create a function with a fixed execution context that can be called later.

The function .call() and .apply() are very similar in their usage except a little difference. .call() is used when the number of the function ’s arguments are known to the programmer, as they have to be mentioned as arguments in the call statement. On the other hand, .apply() is used when the number is not known. The function .apply() expects the argument to be an array.

The basic difference between .call() and .apply() is in the way arguments are passed to the function.

### 16. What is event bubbling?

JavaScript allows DOM elements to be nested inside each other. In such a case, if the handler of the child is clicked, the handler of the parent will also work as if it were clicked too.

### 17. How are DOM utilized in JavaScript?

JavaScript can access all the elements in a web page using the Document Object Model (DOM). The web browser creates a DOM of the `webpage` when the page is loaded.

DOM stands for Document Object Model and is responsible for how various objects in a document interact with each other. DOM is required for developing web pages, which includes objects like paragraphs, links, etc. These objects can be operated to include actions like add or delete. DOM is also required to add extra capabilities to a web page. On top of that, the use of `API` gives an advantage over other existing models.

### 18. What are Screen objects?

Screen objects are used to read the information from the client ’s screen. The properties of screen objects are –

- `AvailHeight`: Gives the height of the client ’s screen
- `AvailWidth`: Gives the width of the client ’s screen
- `ColorDepth`: Gives the bit depth of images on the client ’s screen
- `Height`: Gives the total height of the client ’s screen, including the taskbar
- `Width`: Gives the total width of the client ’s screen, including the taskbar

### 19. Why you should not use `innerHTML` in JavaScript?

`innerHTML` content is refreshed every time and thus is slower. There is no scope for validation in `innerHTML`. Therefore, it is easier to insert rogue code in the document and make the web page unstable.

### . What are the important JavaScript Array Method explain with example?

### 20. JavaScript Array Methods

The Array object has many properties and methods which help developers to handle arrays easily and efficiently. You can get the value of a property by specifying `arrayname.property` and the output of a method by specifying `arrayname.method()`.

- **length property** –> If you want to know the number of elements in an array, you can use the length property.
- **prototype property** –> If you want to add new properties and methods, you can use the prototype property.
- **reverse method** –> You can reverse the order of items in an array using a reverse method.
- **sort method –>** You can sort the items in an array using sort method.
- **pop method** –> You can remove the last item of an array using a pop method.
- **shift method** –> You can remove the first item of an array using shift method.
- **push method** –> You can add a value as the last item of the array.

### 21. What are the difference between `var` , `let` and `const`  keyword in javaScript ？

In JavaScript, `var`, `let`, and `const` are keywords used for variable declaration, but they have some differences in terms of scope and mutability.

1. `var`:
   - Variables declared with `var` have function scope or global scope, meaning they are accessible anywhere within the function or globally if declared outside any function.
   - `var` variables can be redeclared and reassigned.
   - `var` variables are hoisted to the top of their scope, which means they can be accessed before their actual declaration.
2. `let`:
   - Variables declared with `let` have block scope, meaning they are limited to the block (within curly braces) where they are defined.
   - `let` variables can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same scope.
   - `let` variables are not hoisted, so they cannot be accessed before their declaration.
3. `const`:
   - Variables declared with `const` also have block scope.
   - `const` variables are similar to `let`, but they are immutable, meaning their value cannot be changed once assigned.
   - `const` variables must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be left uninitialized.
   - Like `let`, `const` variables are not hoisted and have to be defined before use.

It is generally recommended to use `const` whenever possible for variables that should not be reassigned, as it helps make the code more predictable and maintainable. Use `let` when you need to reassign a variable, and use `var` only if you have specific reasons to do so or if you're targeting older JavaScript versions.

### 22. Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javaScript.

In JavaScript, implicit type coercion is when values are automatically changed from one data type to another while the code is running. It happens when numbers of different types are used in actions or comparisons. JavaScript tries to change the numbers into a type that the action can use. 

### **23. What is the difference between Attributes and Property?**

**Attributes-**  provide more details on an element like id, type, value etc.

**Property-**  is the value assigned to the property like type=”text”, value=’Name’ etc.

### **24. List out the different ways an HTML element can be accessed in a JavaScript code.**

Here are the list of ways an HTML element can be accessed in a Javascript code:
(i) **getElementById(‘idname’):** Gets an element by its ID name
(ii) **getElementsByClass(‘classname’):** Gets all the elements that have the given classname.
(iii) **getElementsByTagName(‘tagname’):** Gets all the elements that have the given tag name.
(iv) **querySelector():** This function takes css style selector and returns the first selected element.

(v) **querySelectorAll():** This function takes css style selector and returns all selected element.

### **25. In how many ways a JavaScript code can be involved in an HTML file?**

There are 3 different ways in which a JavaScript code can be involved in an HTML file:

- **Inline**
- **Internal**
- **External**

An **inline** function is a JavaScript function, which is assigned to a variable created at runtime. You can differentiate between Inline Functions and Anonymous since an inline function is assigned to a variable and can be easily reused. When you need a JavaScript for a function, you can either have the script **integrated** in the page you are working on, or you can have it placed in a **separate** file that you call, when needed. This is the difference between an **internal** script and an **ext****ernal** script.

### 26. Explain Higher Order Functions in javascript.

Higher-order functions in JavaScript are functions that can take other functions as inputs or return functions as their outputs. They make it possible to use strong functional programming methods that make code more flexible, reused, and expressive. By treating functions as first-class citizens, they make it possible to abstract behaviour and make flexible code structures.

### 27. What is the difference between Local storage & Session storage?

**Local Storage** – The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) – reducing the amount of traffic between client and server. It will stay until it is manually cleared through settings or program.

**Session Storage** – It is similar to local storage; the only difference is while data stored in local storage has no expiration time, data stored in session storage gets cleared when the page session ends. Session Storage will leave when the browser is closed.

### **28. What is the difference between null & undefined?**

Undefined means a variable has been **declared** but has not yet been **assigned** a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.

### **29. What is the difference between undeclared & undefined?**

Undeclared variables are those that do not **exist** in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a **runtime error** is encountered. Undefined variables are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.

### **30. What is the difference between window & document in JavaScript?**

|                          **Window**                          |                         **Document**                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| JavaScript window is a global object which holds variables, functions, history, location. | The document also comes under the window and can be considered as the property of the window. |

### **31. What is the difference between innerHTML & innerText?**

**`innerHTML`** – It will process an HTML tag if found in a string

**`innerText`** – It will not process an HTML tag if found in a string

### **32. What is the ‘Strict’ mode in JavaScript and how can it be enabled?**

Strict mode is a way to introduce better error-checking into your code.

- When you use strict mode, you cannot use implicitly declared variables, or assign a value to a read-only property, or add a property to an object that is not extensible.
- You can enable strict mode by adding “use strict” at the beginning of a file, a program, or a function.

### 33. What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?

The scope of variables in JavaScript is used to determine the accessibility of variables and functions at various parts of one’s code. There are three types of scopes of a variable, global scope, function scope, block scope

- Global Scope: It is used to access the variables and functions from anywhere inside the code. 
- Function scope: It is used to declare the function and variables inside the function itself and not outside. 
- Block Scope: It uses let and const to declare the variables.

### 34. What are Imports and Exports in JavaScript?

Imports and exports help in writing modular code for our [JavaScript applications](https://www.simplilearn.com/applications-of-javascript-article). With the help of imports and exports, we can split a JavaScript code into multiple files in a project. This greatly simplifies the application source code and encourages code readability.

### 35. NaN property in JavaScript

NaN property in JavaScript is the “Not-a-Number” value that is not a legal number.

### 36. Immediately Invoked Function in JavaScript

An Immediately Invoked Function also abbreviated as IIFE or IIFY runs as soon as it is defined. To run the function, it needs to be invoked otherwise the declaration of the function is returned.

Syntax:

```
(function(){ // Do something;})();
```

### 37. Higher Order Functions 

Higher-order functions are the functions that take functions as arguments and return them by operating on other functions

### 38. difference between exec () and test () methods

**exec()**

- It is an expression method in JavaScript that is used to search a string with a specific pattern. 
- Once it has been found, the pattern will be returned directly, otherwise, it returns an “empty” result.

**test ()** 

- It is an expression method in JavaScript that is also used to search a string with a specific pattern or text. 
- Once it has been found, the pattern will return the Boolean value 'true', else it returns ‘false’. 

### 39. Use of a constructor function (with examples)

Constructor functions are used to create single objects or multiple objects with similar properties and methods.

Example :

```javascript
function Person(name,age,gender){
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.gender = gender;
}
var person1 = new Person("Vivek", 76, "male");

console.log(person1);

var person2 = new Person("Courtney", 34, "female");

console.log(person2);
```

### 40. Rest parameter and spread operator

- Rest Parameter(...)

- Rest parameter is used to declare the function with improved handling of parameters. 
- Rest parameter syntax can be used to create functions to perform functions on the variable number of arguments.
- It also helps to convert any number of arguments into an array as well as helps in extracting some or all parts of the arguments.

- Spread Operator(...)

- In a function call, we use the spread operator. 
- It's also to spread one or more arguments that are expected in a function call.
- The spread operator is used to take an array or an object and spread them.

### 41. Promises in JavaScript

Promises in JavaScript have four different states. They are as follows: 

| Pending                                                      | Fulfilled                                                    | Rejected                                                     | Settled                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Pending is an initial state of promise. It is the initial state of promise where it is in the pending state that neither is fulfilled nor rejected. | It is the state where the promise has been fulfilled that assures that the async operation is done. | It is the state where the promise is rejected and the async operation has failed. | It is the state where the promise is rejected o |

### 42. Classes in JavaScript

classes are syntactic sugars for constructor functions mentioned in the ES6 version of JavaScript. Classes are not hoisted-like Functions and can’t be used before it is declared. Also, it can inherit properties and methods from other classes with the help of extended keywords. If the strict mode (‘use strict’) is not followed, an error will be shown.

### 43. Prototypal vs Classical Inheritance

- Prototypal Inheritance

- Prototypal inheritance allows any object to be cloned via an object linking method and it serves as a template for those other objects, whether they extend the parent object or not. 

- Classical Inheritance

- Classical inheritance is a class that inherits from the other remaining classes.

### 44. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?

Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior that occurs with variables declared using let and const keywords before they are initialized.

### 45. Difference between Async/Await and Generators 

- Async/Await

- Async-await functions are executed sequentially one after another in an easier way.
- Async/Await function might throw an error when the value is returned.

- Generators

- Generator functions are executed with one output at a time by the generator’s yield by yield. 
- The ‘value: X, done: Boolean’ is the output result of the Generator function.

### 46. What is the difference between Event Capturing and Event Bubbling?

| Event Capturing                                              | Event Bubbling                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| This process starts with capturing the event of the outermost element and then propagating it to the innermost element. | This process starts with capturing the event of the innermost element and then propagating it to the outermost element. |

# React

### **1. What are the features of React?**

|       JSX        | **JSX:**  JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write [HTML](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/html-tutorial/what-is-html) structures in the same file that contains [JavaScript](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/javascript-tutorial/introduction-to-javascript) code. |
| :--------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  **Components**  | **Components:** [Components](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/reactjs-components) are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately. |
| **Virtual DOM**  | **Virtual DOM:** React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects. |
| **Data binding** | **One-way data-binding:** React’s one-way [data binding](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/angular-tutorial/angular-data-binding) keeps everything modular and fast. A unidirectional data flow means that when designing a React app, you often nest child components within parent components. |
|   **High-per**   | **High performance:** React updates only those components that have changed, rather than updating all the components at once. This results in much faster web applications. |

### **2. What is `JSX`?**

`JSX` is a syntax extension of JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using `JSX`, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.

### **3. Can web browsers read JSX directly?** 

- Web browsers cannot read `JSX` directly. This is because they are built to only read regular JS objects and `JSX` is not a regular JavaScript object 
- For a web browser to read a `JSX` file, the file needs to be transformed into a regular JavaScript object. For this, we use Babel.

### **4. What is the virtual DOM?**

DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM represents an HTML document with a logical tree structure. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.

React keeps a lightweight representation of the real DOM in the memory, and that is known as the virtual DOM. When the state of an object changes, the virtual DOM changes only that object in the real DOM, rather than updating all the objects. 

### **5. Why is there a need for using keys in Lists?**

Keys are very important in lists for the following reasons:

- A key is a unique identifier and it is used to identify which items have changed, been updated or deleted from the lists
- It also helps to determine which components need to be re-rendered instead of re-rendering all the components every time. Therefore, it increases performance, as only the updated components are re-rendered

**Importance of keys -**

- Keys help react identify which elements were added, changed or removed.
- Keys should be given to array elements for providing a unique identity for each element.
- Without keys, React does not understand the order or uniqueness of each element.
- With keys, React has an idea of which particular element was deleted, edited, and added.
- Keys are generally used for displaying a list of data coming from an API.

> Note- Keys used within arrays should be unique among siblings. They need not be globally unique.

### 6. What is an arrow function and how is it used in React?**

- An arrow function is a short way of writing a function to React.
- It is unnecessary to bind **‘this’** inside the constructor when using an arrow function. This prevents bugs caused by the use of **‘this’** in React callbacks.

### **7. What are the components in React?**

Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. A component is essentially a piece of the user interface. It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately.

There are two types of components in React:

- **Functional Components:** These types of components have no state of their own and only contain render methods, and therefore are also called **stateless components**. They may derive data from other components as props (properties).

- **Class Components:** These types of components can hold and manage their own state and have a separate render method to return JSX on the screen. They are also called Stateful components as they can have a state.

### **8. What is the use of render() in React?**

- It is required for each component to have a render() function. This function returns the HTML, which is to be displayed in the component.
- If you need to render more than one element, all of the elements must be inside one parent tag like `<div>`,` <form>`.

### **9. What is a state in React?**

- The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. The state in a component can change over time, and whenever it changes, the component re-renders.
- The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system-generated events. It determines the behavior of the component and how it will render.

### **10. What are props in React?**

In React, "props" is a short form for "properties" and refers to the input data that is passed into a component. Props are used to customize and configure components, allowing them to be dynamic and reusable.

When you create a component in React, you can define custom attributes, or props, for that component. These props are like parameters that you pass from a parent component to its child component. The child component can then access and use the props to render its output and behavior.

Props are read-only and should not be modified within the child component. They are passed down from parent to child components and can be accessed using the `this.props` keyword in class components or as a parameter to the functional component.

Props can contain various types of data, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, or even functions. By adjusting the props passed to a component, you can control its rendering and behavior dynamically, making React components flexible and reusable.

### **11. What is a higher-order component in React?**

A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a design pattern in React that allows you to reuse component logic. It is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new enhanced component. The HOC itself does not render anything, but it enhances the behavior of the input component by adding additional props or modifying its functionality.

HOCs are often used to implement cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, logging, or data fetching. They provide a way to separate reusable logic from the presentational components, making the code more modular and reusable.

By using HOCs, you can enhance multiple components with the same behavior without duplicating code. This promotes code reusability and maintainability in larger React applications.

### **12. Explain the lifeCycle methods of components.**

- **`constructor()`:** This is executed before the creation of the component.
- **`componentDidMount()`:** Is executed when the component gets rendered and placed on the DOM.
- **`shouldComponentUpdate()`:** Is invoked when a component determines changes to the DOM and returns a “true” or “false” value based on certain conditions.
- **`componentDidUpdate()`:** Is invoked immediately after rendering takes place.
- **`componentWillUnmount()`:** Is invoked immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted permanently.

### **13. What is React Router?**

React Router is a routing library built on top of React, which is used to create routes in a React application. This is one of the most frequently asked react interview questions.

### **14. Why do we need to React Router?**

- It maintains consistent structure and behavior and is used to develop single-page web applications. 
- Enables multiple views in a single application by defining multiple routes in the React application.

### 15. What is `useState()` in React?

The `useState()` is a built-in React Hook that allows you for having state variables in functional components. It should be used when the DOM has something that is dynamically manipulating/controlling.

In the below-given example code, The `useState(0)` will return a tuple where the count is the first parameter that represents the counter ’s current state and the second parameter `setCounter` method will allow us to update the state of the counter.

```plaintext
const [count, setCounter] = useState(0);
```

We can make use of `setCounter()` method for updating the state of count anywhere. In this example, we are using `setCounter()` inside the `setCount` function where various other things can also be done. The idea with the usage of hooks is that we will be able to keep our code more functional and avoid class-based components if they are not required.

### 16. How do you style React components?

In React, there are multiple ways to style components:

**`Inline Styling`:** We can directly style an element using `inline` style attributes. Make sure the value of style is a JavaScript object:

**`Using JavaScript object`:** We can create a separate JavaScript object and set the desired style properties. This object can be used as the value of the `inline` style attribute.

**`CSS Stylesheet`:** We can create a separate `CSS` file and write all the styles for the component inside that file. This file needs to be imported inside the component file.

**`CSS Modules`:** We can create a separate `CSS` module and import this module inside our component. Create a file with “`.module.css`”‘ extension, `styles.module.css`

### 17. What are the differences between functional and class components?

Before the introduction of Hooks in React, functional components were called stateless components and were behind class components on a feature basis. After the introduction of Hooks, functional components are equivalent to class components.

On the following basis let ’s compare functional and class components:

- **Declaration**

Functional components are nothing but JavaScript functions and therefore can be declared using an arrow function or the function keyword.

Class components, on the other hand, are declared using the `ES6` class.

- **Handling props**

In functional components, the handling of props is pretty straightforward. Any prop provided as an argument to a functional component can be directly used inside HTML elements

In the case of class components, props are handled in a different way，**this** keyword is used in the case of class components.

- **Handling state**

Functional components use React hooks to handle state. It uses the `useState` hook to set the state of a variable inside the component

Since `useState` hook returns an array of two items, the first item contains the current state, and the second item is a function used to update the state.

We cannot use React Hooks inside class components, therefore state handling is done very differently in a class component:

For reading the state, we are using **`this.state.variableName`**.

For updating the state, we need to use the **`setState`** function which is used to update the state

### 18. What is the virtual DOM? How does react use the virtual DOM to render the UI?

As stated by the react team, virtual DOM is a concept where a virtual representation of the real DOM is kept inside the memory and is synced with the real DOM by a library such as `ReactDOM`.

**Why was virtual DOM introduced?** 

DOM manipulation is an integral part of any web application, but DOM manipulation is quite slow when compared to other operations in JavaScript. The efficiency of the application gets affected when several DOM manipulations are being done. Most JavaScript frameworks update the entire DOM even when a small part of the DOM changes.

For example, consider a list that is being rendered inside the DOM. If one of the items in the list changes, the entire list gets rendered again instead of just rendering the item that was changed/updated. This is called inefficient updating.

To address the problem of inefficient updating, the react team introduced the concept of virtual DOM.

**How does it work?**

For every DOM object, there is a corresponding virtual DOM object(copy), which has the same properties. The main difference between the real DOM object and the virtual DOM object is that any changes in the virtual DOM object will not reflect on the screen directly. Consider a virtual DOM object as a blueprint of the real DOM object. Whenever a `JSX` element gets rendered, every virtual DOM object gets updated.

> **Note- One may think updating every virtual DOM object might be inefficient, but that ’s not the case. Updating the virtual DOM is much faster than updating the real DOM since we are just updating the blueprint of the real DOM.

React uses two virtual `DOMs` to render the user interface. One of them is used to store the current state of the objects and the other to store the previous state of the objects. Whenever the virtual DOM gets updated, react compares the two virtual `DOMs` and gets to know about which virtual DOM objects were updated. After knowing which objects were updated, react renders only those objects inside the real DOM instead of rendering the complete real DOM. This way, with the use of virtual DOM, react solves the problem of inefficient updating.

### 19. What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components?

Controlled and uncontrolled components are just different approaches to handling input from elements in react. 

- **Controlled component:** In a controlled component, the value of the input element is controlled by React. We store the state of the input element inside the code, and by using event-based callbacks, any changes made to the input element will be reflected in the code as well.

When a user enters data inside the input element of a controlled component, onChange function gets triggered and inside the code, we check whether the value entered is valid or invalid. If the value is valid, we change the state and re-render the input element with the new value.

- **Uncontrolled component:** In an uncontrolled component, the value of the input element is handled by the DOM itself. Input elements inside uncontrolled components work just like normal HTML input form elements.

  The state of the input element is handled by the DOM. Whenever the value of the input element is changed, event-based callbacks are not called. Basically, react does not perform any action when there are changes made to the input element.

  Whenever use enters data inside the input field, the updated data is shown directly. To access the value of the input element, we can use **ref**

### 20. What is the use of `useEffect` React Hooks?

The `useEffect` React Hook is used for performing the side effects in functional components. With the help of `useEffect`, you will inform React that your component requires something to be done after rendering the component or after a state change. The function you have passed(can be referred to as “effect”) will be remembered by React and call afterwards the performance of DOM updates is over. Using this, we can perform various calculations such as data fetching, setting up document title, manipulating DOM directly, etc, that don ’t target the output value. The `useEffect` hook will run by default after the first render and also after each update of the component. React will guarantee that the DOM will be updated by the time when the effect has run by it.

The `useEffect` React Hook will accept 2 arguments: `useEffect(callback,[dependencies]);`

Where the first argument callback represents the function having the logic of side-effect and it will be immediately executed after changes were being pushed to DOM. The second argument dependencies represent an optional array of dependencies. The `useEffect()` will execute the callback only if there is a change in dependencies in between renderings.

Consider you don ’t want to execute document title update each time on rendering of `WelcomeGreetings` component and you want it to be executed only when the name prop changes then you need to supply name as a dependency to `useEffect(callback, [name])`.

### 21. What are Custom Hooks?

A Custom Hook is a function in `Javascript` whose name begins with ‘use’ and which calls other hooks. It is a part of `React v16.8` hook update and permits you for reusing the `stateful` logic without any need for component hierarchy restructuring.

In almost all of the cases, custom hooks are considered to be sufficient for replacing render props and `HoCs` (Higher-Order components) and reducing the amount of nesting required. Custom Hooks will allow you for avoiding multiple layers of abstraction or wrapper hell that might come along with Render Props and `HoCs`.

The **disadvantage** of Custom Hooks is it cannot be used inside of the classes.

### 22. Name a few techniques to optimize React app performance.

There are many ways through which one can optimize the performance of a React app, let’s have a look at some of them:

- Using `useMemo`( )
  - It is a React hook that is used for caching CPU-Expensive functions.
  - Sometimes in a React app, a CPU-Expensive function gets called repeatedly due to re-renders of a component, which can lead to slow rendering.
    `useMemo( )` hook can be used to cache such functions. By using `useMemo( )`, the CPU-Expensive function gets called only when it is needed.
- Using `React.PureComponent` -
  - It is a base component class that checks the state and props of a component to know whether the component should be updated.
  - Instead of using the simple `React.Component`, we can use `React.PureComponent` to reduce the re-renders of a component unnecessarily.
- Maintaining State `Colocation` -
  - This is a process of moving the state as close to where you need it as possible.
  - Sometimes in React `app`, we have a lot of unnecessary states inside the parent component which makes the code less readable and harder to maintain. Not to forget, having many states inside a single component leads to unnecessary re-renders for the component.
  - It is better to shift states which are less valuable to the parent component, to a separate component.
- Lazy Loading -
  -  It is a technique used to reduce the load time of a React app. Lazy loading helps reduce the risk of web app performances to a minimum.

### 23. How to pass data between react components?

**Parent Component to Child Component (using props)**

With the help of props, we can send data from a parent to a child component.

**Child Component to Parent Component (using callbacks)**

- Create a callback in the parent component which takes in the data needed as a parameter.
- Pass this callback as a prop to the child component.
- Send data from the child component using the callback.

### 24. How does the performance of using Hooks will differ in comparison with the classes?

- React Hooks will avoid a lot of overheads such as the instance creation, binding of events, etc., that are present with classes.
- Hooks in React will result in smaller component trees since they will be avoiding the nesting that exists in `HOCs` (Higher Order Components) and will render props which result in less amount of work to be done by React.

### 25. Explain conditional rendering in React.

Conditional rendering refers to the dynamic output of user interface markups based on a condition state. It works in the same way as JavaScript conditions. Using conditional rendering, it is possible to toggle specific application functions, `API` data rendering, hide or show elements, decide permission levels, authentication handling, and so on.

There are different approaches for implementing conditional rendering in React. Some of them are:

- Using if-else conditional logic which is suitable for smaller as well as for medium-sized applications
- Using ternary operators, which takes away some amount of complication from if-else statements
- Using element variables, which will enable us to write cleaner code.

### 26. How to pass data between sibling components using React router?

Passing data between sibling components of React is possible using React Router with the help of `history.push` and `match.params`.

We have a Parent component` AppDemo.js` and have two Child Components `HomePage` and `AboutPage`. Everything is kept inside a Router by using React-router Route. It is also having a route for `/about/{params}` where we will pass the data.

The `HomePage` is a functional component with a button. On button click, we are using `props.history.push(‘/about/’ + data)` to `programmatically` navigate into `/about/data`.

Also, the functional component `AboutPage` will obtain the data passed by `props.match.params.aboutId`.

### 27. How to perform automatic redirect after login?

The react-router package will provide the component `<Redirect>` in React Router. Rendering of a `<Redirect>` component will navigate to a newer location. In the history stack, the current location will be overridden by the new location just like the server-side redirects.

```
<Redirect to="/your/redirect/page" />
```

### 28. What is `Redux`?

[Redux](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/react-with-redux) is an open-source, JavaScript library used to manage the application state. React uses `Redux` to build the user interface. It is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications and is used for the entire application ’s state management.

### **29. What are the components of `Redux`?**

- **Store:** Holds the state of the application.
- **Action:** The source information for the store.
- **Reducer:** Specifies how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

### **30. What can you do with HOC?**

HOC can be used for many tasks like:

- Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction
- Render High jacking
- State abstraction and manipulation
- Props manipulation

### **31. What are Pure Components?**

*Pure* components are the simplest and fastest components which can be written. They can replace any component which only has a **render().** These components enhance the simplicity of the code and performance of the application.

### **32. What is the significance of Store in `Redux`?**

A store is a JavaScript object which can hold the application ’s state and provide a few helper methods to access the state, dispatch actions and register listeners. The entire state/ object tree of an application is saved in a single store. As a result of this, `Redux` is very simple and predictable. We can pass `middleware` to the store to handle the processing of data as well as to keep a log of various actions that change the state of stores. All the actions return a new state via reducers.

### **33. Explain the concept of a Context in React.**

In React, context is a way to share data that is considered “global” for a component tree. It allows you to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

A component that needs to access the context data can consume it by using the `useContext` hook or the Consumer component. To make the context available to a component, a parent component needs to provide it using the Provider component.

Context is often used for data that is required by many components in an application, such as the currently authenticated user, the current locale, or the theme.

It should be noted that context should be used sparingly, as it can make your components more difficult to reason about and test. If possible, it ’s better to pass props down the component tree manually.

### **34. How do you handle asynchronous data loading in a React application?**

In a React application, asynchronous data loading can be handled using a technique called “lifting state up”. This involves moving the state that manages the loading and error state of the data to a common ancestor component, and passing down the necessary callbacks and state through props to the components that need to use the data.

One popular way to handle `async` data loading is to use the `useEffect` hook in combination with fetch or a library like `axios` to load data in a component after it has been rendered. The `useEffect` hook allows you to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a server, by running a side effect (the data loading) after the component has rendered. The hook takes a callback function that contains the effect, and an array of dependencies.

Another way is to use a library like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga` to handle the `async` request and store the data in the store/state. These libraries provide an easy way to handle `async` actions and keep the component state clean.

In either case, it’s important to keep an eye on the component ’s state and update it properly with the loaded data.

### **35. What is the difference between state and props in React?**

State and Props are both concepts in React that are used to store and manipulate data within a React component. The main difference between the two is that State is used to store and manage the data that is local and specific to a component, while Props are used to pass data from a parent component to its child components.

State is considered to be dynamic, meaning that it can change over time as a result of user interactions or other events. On the other hand, Props are considered to be static and cannot be changed by the child component. Instead, the parent component is responsible for updating the value of its Props and passing the updated value to the child component.

In summary, State is used to manage the internal state of a component, while Props are used to pass data from a parent component to its child components.

- Improved readability.

### 4. Explain the difference between `frontend` and `backend` development?

| **Front-end**                                                | **Back-end**                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Frontend` refers to the client-side of an application       | `Backend` refers to the server-side of an application        |
| It is the part of a web application that users can see and interact with | It constitutes everything that happens behind the scenes     |
| It typically includes everything that attributes to the visual aspects of a web application | It generally includes a web server that communicates with a database to serve requests |
| `HTML`, `CSS`,` JavaScript` and `ReactJS` are some of the essentials of `frontend` development | `Java`, `PHP`, `Python`, and `Node.js` are some of the `backend` development technologies |

### 5. What is `NPM`?

**`NPM`** stands for Node Package Manager, responsible for managing all the packages and modules for `Node.js`.

Node Package Manager provides two main functionalities:

- Provides `online` repositories for `node.js` packages/modules, which are `searchable` on `search.nodejs.org`
- Provides command-line utility to install `Node.js` packages and also manages `Node.js` versions and dependencies 

### 6. What is the purpose of the module .Exports?

In `Node.js`, a module encapsulates all related codes into a single unit of code that can be parsed by moving all relevant functions into a single file. You may export a module with the module and export the function, which lets it be imported into another file with a needed keyword.

### 7. Why is `Node.js` preferred over other `backend` technologies like `Java` and `PHP`?

Some of the reasons why `Node.js` is preferred include:

- `Node.js` is very fast
- Node Package Manager has over 50,000 bundles available at the developer ’s disposal
- Perfect for data-intensive, real-time web applications, as `Node.js` never waits for an `API` to return data
- Better synchronization of code between server and client due to same code base
- Easy for web developers to start using `Node.js` in their projects as it is a JavaScript library

### 8. Which database is more popularly used with `Node.js`?

`MongoDB` is the most common database used with `Node.js`. It is a `NoSQL`, cross-platform, document-oriented database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

### 9. What are some of the most commonly used libraries in `Node.js`?

There are two commonly used libraries in `Node.js`:

- **`ExpressJS`** - Express is a flexible `Node.js` web application framework that provides a wide set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
- **`Mongoose`** - Mongoose is also a `Node.js` web application framework that makes it easy to connect an application to a database.

### 10. What is the command used to import external libraries?

The “require” command is used for importing external libraries. For example - **“`var http = require (“HTTP”)`.”**  This will load the HTTP library and the single exported object through the HTTP variable.

### 11. What is the `Express.js` package?

Express is a flexible `Node.js` web application framework that provides a wide set of features to develop both web and mobile applications

### 12. How do you create a simple `Express.js` application?

- The request object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on
- The response object represents the HTTP response that an Express `app` sends when it receives an HTTP request

###  13. How do you install, update, and delete a dependency?

  **Install dependency**  :      `npm install  express`

  **Update dependency**  :      `npm update`

  **`UnInstall` dependency**  :      `npm uninstall  express`

### 14. How do you create a simple server in Node.js that returns Hello World?

- Import the HTTP module
- Use `createServer` function with a callback function using request and response as parameters.
- Type “hello world." 
- Set the server to listen to port 8080 and assign an `IP` address

### 15. What is callback hell?

- Callback hell, also known as the pyramid of doom, is the result of intensively nested, unreadable, and unmanageable callbacks, which in turn makes the code harder to read and debug
- improper implementation of the asynchronous logic causes callback hell

### 16. Explain the concept of `middleware` in `Node.js`.

`Middleware` is a function that receives the request and response objects. Most tasks that the `middleware` functions perform are:  

- Execute any code
- Update or modify the request and the response objects
- Finish the request-response cycle
- Invoke the next `middleware` in the stack

### 17. What are the different types of HTTP requests?

HTTP defines a set of request methods used to perform desired actions. The request methods include:

**GET:** Used to retrieve the data

**POST:** Generally used to make a change in state or reactions on the server

**HEAD:** Similar to the GET method, but asks for the response without the response body

**DELETE:** Used to delete the predetermined resource

### 18. How would you connect a `MongoDB` database to `Node.js`?

To create a database in `MongoDB`:

- Start by creating a `MongoClient` object
- Specify a connection URL with the correct `IP` address and the name of the database you want to create

### 19. What is the purpose of the `module.exports`?

The module. exports object in `Node.js` is used to export functions, objects, or values from a module and is returned as the value of the require() function when another module requires a module.

### 20. What is the difference between JavaScript and Node.js?

`Node.js` is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser, while JavaScript is a programming language that can be executed in both web browsers and Node.js environments.

### 21. What is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous functions?

Synchronous functions block the execution of other code until they are complete, while asynchronous functions allow other code to continue executing while they are running, making them essential for writing scalable `Node.js` applications.

### 22. What are the asynchronous tasks that should occur in an event loop?

Asynchronous tasks that should occur in an event loop in `Node.js` include I/O operations, timers, and callback functions. By performing these tasks asynchronously, `Node.js` can handle a large number of concurrent requests without blocking the event loop.

### 23. What is the advantage of using `Node.js`?

`Node.js` is fast and scalable. `Node.js` is easy to learn and use. `Node.js` is well-suited for real-time applications, such as chat applications, `online` games, and streaming services. This is because `Node.js` can handle a large number of connections and can perform non-blocking I/O operations, which makes it ideal for real-time communication.

### 24. Does Node run on Windows?

Yes, `Node.js` runs on Windows. `Node.js` is a cross-platform runtime environment, which means that it can run on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, `macOS`, and Linux.

### 25. Can you access DOM in Node?

No, you cannot access the DOM in `Node.js`. The DOM is a browser-specific `API` that allows for the manipulation of HTML and XML documents. Since `Node.js` does not run in a browser, it does not have access to the DOM.

### 26. How can we use `async` `await` in `node.js`?

To use `async/await` in `Node.js`, you'll need to use functions that return promises. You can then use the `async` keyword to mark a function as asynchronous and the await keyword to wait for a promise to resolve before continuing with the rest of the code.

### **27. Why is `Express.js` used?**

`Node JS Express` is a widely used framework built using `Node.js`. `Express.js` uses a management point that controls data flow between servers and server-side applications.

Being lightweight and flexible,`Express.js` provides users with lots of features used to design mobile applications.

### **28. Where is `package.json` used in `Node.js`?**

The `package.json` file is a file that contains the `metadata` about all items in a project. It can also be used as a project identifier and deployed as a means to handle all of the project dependencies.

### 29. Why should you separate Express `app` and server?

The server is responsible for initializing the routes, `middleware`, and other application logic whereas the `app` has all the business logic which will be served by the routes initiated by the server. This ensures that the business logic is encapsulated and decoupled from the application logic which makes the project more readable and maintainable.

### **30. What is the purpose of the `crypto` module in `Node.js`?**

The `crypto` module in `Node.js` is used to provide users with cryptographic functionalities. This provides them with a large number of wrappers to perform various operations such as ciphering, deciphering, signing, and hashing.

### 31. How many types of `API` functions are there in `Node.js`?

There are two types of `API` functions:

- **Asynchronous, non-blocking functions** - mostly I/O operations which can be fork out of the main loop.
- **Synchronous, blocking functions** - mostly operations that influence the process running in the main loop.

### 32. What is a blocking code? 

If application has to wait for some I/O operation in order to complete its execution any further then the code responsible for waiting is known as blocking code.
